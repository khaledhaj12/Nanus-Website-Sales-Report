## Changelog

```
Changelog:
- July 02, 2025. Initial setup
- July 02, 2025. Completed location duplicate consolidation - eliminated 4 duplicate locations affecting 580+ orders, consolidated into 3 standardized locations with proper naming conventions
- July 02, 2025. Fixed monthly breakdown date filtering bug in both dashboard and reports pages - orders now correctly display under their proper month sections with month-first filtering logic
- July 02, 2025. Fixed timezone double-conversion issue - removed incorrect UTC to Eastern timezone conversion since WooCommerce orders are already stored in local timezone, ensuring orders appear in correct date groups (order 16196 now correctly shows as July 2nd instead of July 1st)
- July 02, 2025. Fixed auto-sync query parameters - changed from modified_after/modified_before to after/before to catch newly created orders instead of only modified orders, and added checkout-draft status to filter. Missing orders 30682, 30683, 30685 now successfully imported and visible on dashboard
- July 02, 2025. Fixed Reports page monthly grouping inconsistency - added user permission logic and status filtering to Reports endpoint to exactly match Dashboard behavior, ensuring both pages show identical monthly breakdown filtering
- July 02, 2025. Synchronized default status filtering between Dashboard and Reports pages - both now default to ["completed", "processing", "refunded"] for consistent filtering experience across the platform
- July 02, 2025. Final timezone fix - removed UTC timezone overrides from both Dashboard and Reports date displays to ensure consistent local timezone display matching actual order receipt times (order 30635 now correctly appears under July in both pages)
- July 02, 2025. Fixed root cause of timezone date grouping issue - replaced toISOString() with local date formatting in backend monthly breakdown logic to prevent UTC conversion that was shifting July 1st orders to June 30th. This fix applies to all historical and future orders
- July 02, 2025. Critical schema fix - corrected schema mapping from 'orders' table to actual 'woo_orders' database table with proper field mappings (order_date â†’ orderDate), resolving fundamental data access issues that were causing timezone display problems
- July 02, 2025. Timezone fix implementation - discovered WooCommerce stores UTC time but frontend needs Eastern display, modified backend date serialization to treat stored times as Eastern timezone, added cache control headers to force fresh data delivery
- July 02, 2025. Completed timezone fix for both Dashboard and Reports pages - Order 30685 now correctly displays 1:04 PM instead of 9:04 AM, implemented identical timezone processing and cache invalidation for consistent display across platform
- July 02, 2025. Critical auto-sync bug fix - discovered sync was missing orders created within minute of sync window, added 10-minute buffer to catch orders created during sync intervals, manually imported missing order 30691 and reset sync timestamps to ensure future orders are captured
